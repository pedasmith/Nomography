# About Nomographs

## Type II nomographs: U and V can have different scales.

Sometimes you want the U and V to be drawn to different scale. This is usually because the range of one value is much different from the other. This is easy to do with Type II nomographs: they just have the W scale moved to a different position and has a differnt scaling factor.

The type I nomograph have the U and V drawn to the same scale (e.g., the distance between 0 to 1 on the U scale is the exact same distance as 0 to 1 on the V scale). 

The calculations for the W scale are simple. 

### W x = U . (U + V)

### W scale = U * V / (U + V)

Note: if the U and V scales are the same, this reduces to the Type I nomograph formula. For example, supposed both the U and V scales are "3" (in whatever units). The the W scale is (3*3) / (3+3) = 9/6 or 1.5, which is exactly half of the U or V scale.

Or, if the U and V are both 1, then the W scale is 1*1 / (1+1) = 1/2 = 0.5, and again it's half of the U or V scale.
