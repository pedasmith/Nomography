Experimental code to generate Nomograms via JavaScript, generating SVG output. The nomographs are interactive.

To try it, run the docs/ExampleHtml/Example_Nomogram.html file in a web browser.

The generic Nomograph code is in Nomograph.js (and the .css file). Examples from the 1947 book "Elements Of Nomography" are in the corresponding js file.
